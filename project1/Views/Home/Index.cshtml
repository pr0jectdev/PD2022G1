    Secure access service edge (SASE) is a cybersecurity concept that creates a secure link between applications/services and organizational elements like people, systems and devices.
    Because of the digital transformation of businesses, security architecture is also getting transferred into the cloud. This is in part because the cloud provides considerable wide area network (WAN) capacity to support digital businesses across the world.
    Market researchers believe SASE can protect businesses against cyberthreats, and some SASE providers now offer secure web gateways (SWGs).
